# Recognition-of-Tweet-Emotion-using-Keras-Multi-Class-Text-Classification

Created a recurrent neural network (Bidirectional LSTM) and trained it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions (joy, love, fear, surprise, sadness, anger). This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. Used TensorFlow as machine learning framework. Projct describes how to use the Tensorflow to start performing natural language processing tasks like text classification.

Following objectives are covered:

1. Using a Tokenizer in TensorFlow
2. Padding and Truncating Sequences
3. Creating and Training a Recurrent Neural Network
4. Using NLP and Deep Learning to perform Text Classification
